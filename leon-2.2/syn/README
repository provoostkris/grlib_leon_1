LEON synthesis scripts
----------------------

Three files are provided:

leon.prj	project file for Synplify/Amplify

leon.dcsh	script for Synopsys DC

leon.fc2	script for Synopsys FPGA-Compiler/FPGA-Express


The synopsys scripts are just templates to show which order the
files should be analysed. Edit them to reflect your desired target
technology and timing constraints.

NOTE: all LEON files are read from the standard leon source
directory (../leon), MAKE SURE ../leon/device.vhd REFLECTS YOUR
TARGET SETTINGS!!!
